## Features to Try!

- This clone allows you to search certain locations for airbnb stays
- The home page is a replica on Airbnb's home page
- The 3 main locations that work with this clone are searches for stays in London, New York, Boston so those can be typed into the seach bar.
- The search bar in the header has a calender that will drop down when typing starts
- Select the dates you are looking to stay in that location and select the number of guests
- One you press search you will be redirected to show the stays in that searched location 
- Each location has a certain Longitude and Lattitude, and you can see them as pins on the GPS map to the right.
